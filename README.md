## üõ† How to Run

**Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Proser-V/portfolio-project.git
```

**Run locally with Docker:**

1. Make sure Docker is installed on your system  
   - [Download Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) (Windows / macOS)  
   - or install Docker Engine on Linux (`sudo apt install docker docker-compose`)

2. Start Docker (Docker Desktop or Docker daemon)

3. Setup backend configuration

The backend requires some secret values (JWT secret, database credentials, etc.).  
For security reasons, the `application.properties` file is **not included in the repository**.

To run the backend, you will need to:

- Receive the `application.properties` file directly from the project owner (via email or other secure channel).  
- Place it in the backend resources folder: /backend/src/main/resources/
- Once the file is in place, you can build and run the application (step 4).

4. In the project root, build and run all containers:
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

**Access to the app:**

[Home page](http://localhost:3000/)

The backend API is also available for testing at:
[Swagger](http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html)
